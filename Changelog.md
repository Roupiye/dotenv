**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/bkeepers/dotenv/compare/v3.0.0...v3.0.1

## 3.0.0

**Breaking Changes**

* Ruby >= 3.0 and Rails >= 6.1 are now required. Lock dotenv to `~> 2.0` if you are using an outdated Ruby or Rails version. https://github.com/bkeepers/dotenv/pull/466, https://github.com/bkeepers/dotenv/pull/471
* `\n` is no longer expanded into a newline in quoted strings. Use multi-line strings with real line breaks, or set `DOTENV_LINEBREAK_MODE=legacy` to preserve the old behavior. @nitsujri https://github.com/bkeepers/dotenv/pull/423
* `ENV` will be [automatically restored between tests](https://github.com/bkeepers/dotenv#autorestore-in-tests) (`ActiveSupport::TestCase` and `Rspec`). https://github.com/bkeepers/dotenv/pull/472, https://github.com/bkeepers/dotenv/pull/475
* Fixed precedence when using `Dotenv::Rails.overload`. So now `.env.development.local` will overwrite `.env.local`, which will overwrite `.env.development`, which will overwrite `.env`. @eriklovmo - https://github.com/bkeepers/dotenv/pull/460
* The instrumentation event `dotenv.load` has been renamed to `load.dotenv` to properly make use of namespaces in [ActiveSupport::Notifications](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/v7.0/active_support_instrumentation.html#creating-custom-events) https://github.com/bkeepers/dotenv/pull/473

**Other improvements**

* All changes to ENV will be logged in Rails apps. https://github.com/bkeepers/dotenv/pull/473
* Fixed an issue where `rake` loaded development files (`.env*development`) for test-related tasks. https://github.com/bkeepers/dotenv/pull/470
* Add `-i`/`--ignore` option to `dotenv` CLI to optionally ignore missing files. @stevenharman https://github.com/bkeepers/dotenv/pull/463
* You can [customize which files get loaded](https://github.com/bkeepers/dotenv#customizing-rails) by setting `Dotenv::Rails.files`. https://github.com/bkeepers/dotenv/pull/468

**Deprecations**
* The `dotenv-rails` gem is now superfluous. It's not technically deprecated yet and will continue to work, but the `dotenv` gem does the same thing. https://github.com/bkeepers/dotenv/pull/468
* `Dotenv::Railtie` has been deprecated. Use `Dotenv::Rails`. https://github.com/bkeepers/dotenv/pull/468
* `Dotenv.overload` has been replaced with `overwrite`. `overload` will still work and is not technically deprecated, but documentation refers to `Dotenv.overwrite` now. https://github.com/bkeepers/dotenv/pull/469
